Among several unveiled key questions about the universe, neutrinos' masses and its mechanism are clear evidence beyond the Standard Model (SM).
In addition, unique chiral structure of the weak interaction of the SM is unnatural 
in the sense of parity violation without certain source of it.
The left-right symmetric extension of the SM is traditional way to explain the parity violation with specific Higgs sector, for example, a bi-doublet and two triplets,
which takes the see-saw mechanism into the model in natural way that can explain the smallness of neutrino masses. The model's ${SU(2)}_{L} \times {SU(2)}_{R} \times {U(1)}_{B - L}$ group
is reduced to the group indentical to the SM, ${SU(2)}_{L} \times {U(1)}_{Y}$, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of Higgs sector, and, once again to ${U(1)}_{em}$ also by SSB.

In this thesis, the search for pair production of heavy neutrinos via the decay of new neutral gauge boson ($\Zp$) in the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \TeV$ in same flavor di-lepton ($\Pe$ or $\Pgm$) plus at least two jets channel is presented.
The data set corresponds to the integrated luminosity of $137.4 {\unit{fb}}^{-1}$ collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
